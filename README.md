The <b>Jammo Character</b> is a free 3D model that you can use in your projects!

Jammo is part of a collaboration between the [Mix and Jam](https://bit.ly/mixandjam) and [Curiomatic](https://youtube.com/curiomatic) Youtube channels.

The model rig was carefully tweaked to work with the [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#) website - which means that you can just drag the .fbx file there and try the variety of animations available on Mixamo's library!

• Triangle count: 16.088<br>
• Material count: 2 (Body and head visor)<br>
• Available textures: Albedo, Metallic Smoothness, Normal Map and Ambient Occlusion.<br>
• Example Scenes: Third person camera control (using Cinemachine) with an example movement script.

We hope you have a lot of fun with the character!
